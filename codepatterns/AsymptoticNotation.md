# Asymptotic Notation - Big O, Theta, and Omega

Welcome to the **Asymptotic Notation Guide!** üöÄ This document explains **Big O, Theta (Œò), and Omega (Œ©) Notations**, their significance in algorithm analysis, and provides practical examples.

## üìå What is Asymptotic Notation?

Asymptotic notation is used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of **time complexity** and **space complexity** as input size **n** grows.

## ‚è≥ Common Asymptotic Notations

| Notation            | Meaning     | Definition                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O(f(n)) (Big O)** | Upper Bound | Worst-case complexity: Algorithm takes at most `f(n)` time.   |
| **Œò(f(n)) (Theta)** | Tight Bound | Average-case complexity: Algorithm runs in exact `f(n)` time. |
| **Œ©(f(n)) (Omega)** | Lower Bound | Best-case complexity: Algorithm takes at least `f(n)` time.   |

## üìä Complexity Classes & Examples

| Complexity   | Notation     | Example                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constant     | `O(1)`       | Accessing an array element `arr[i]`                            |
| Logarithmic  | `O(log n)`   | Binary search                                                  |
| Linear       | `O(n)`       | Looping through an array                                       |
| Linearithmic | `O(n log n)` | Merge Sort, Quick Sort (average case)                          |
| Quadratic    | `O(n¬≤)`      | Nested loops (e.g., Bubble Sort)                               |
| Exponential  | `O(2‚Åø)`      | Recursion-heavy problems (e.g., Fibonacci without memoization) |
